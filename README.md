The following animation illustrates a simulation of our tool, where 2 absolute minutes represent 200 ms simulation. The model is trained every 200 ms, therefore reevaluating the model parameters if there is any new patient entering on those 2 minutes interval. The model therefore shifts the prediction moment by 1 hour each 6 seconds.
